 * Intercepts `HttpRequest` or `HttpResponse` and handles them.

 * next interceptor in the chain, by calling `next.handle(transformedReq)`.
 * An interceptor may choose to transform the
 * response event stream as well, by applying additional Rx operators on the stream
 * returned by `next.handle()`.
 *
 * More rarely, an interceptor may choose to handle the request itself completely,
 * and compose a new event stream instead of invoking `next.handle()`. This is an
 * acceptable behavior, but keep in mind that further interceptors will be skipped entirely.
 *
 * It is also rare but valid for an interceptor to return multiple responses on the
 * event stream for a single request.
