# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.
# See documentation in /docs/BAZEL.md

# Save downloaded repositories in a location that can be cached by CircleCI. This helps us
# speeding up the analysis time significantly with Bazel managed node dependencies on the CI.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
# TODO(gmagolan): Hide progress again once build performance improves
# Presently, CircleCI can timeout during bazel test ... with the following
# error: Too long with no output (exceeded 10m0s)
# build --noshow_progress

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others
# (e.g. /etc/bazel.bazelrc vs. tools/bazel.rc)

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming resources that fit in CircleCI "xlarge" class

# We have seen some flakiness in using TS workers on CircleCI
# https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C07DT5M6V/p1562693245183400
# > failures like `ERROR: /home/circleci/ng/packages/core/test/BUILD.bazel:5:1:
# > Compiling TypeScript (devmode) //packages/core/test:test_lib failed: Worker process did not return a WorkResponse:`
# > I saw that issue a couple times today.
# > Example job: https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/385517
# We expect that TypeScript compilations will parallelize wider than the number of local cores anyway
# so we should saturate remote workers with TS compilations
